# Employee Tracker

This application is an employee management system, which runs using node.js.  When the application starts, the user is shown a list of options to select: View All Employees, Add Employee, Update Employee Role, View All Roles, Add Role, View All Departments & Quit.  All employee information is storied in an "employees" database, so when the user selects an option, (view or add/update) they will be able to update or view the corresponding information in that database.
